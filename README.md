* This is the Movie Recommendation Android Application - "Titanic". 

* **Firebase** has been used to integrate *Google Sign-In* and *Email Sign-Up* functionalities. 

* The App majorly uses TMBD Web Api to fetch the relevant information/detail for the movies.

* The user has to rate any 5 movies of his choice and would be given recommendations based on his input. Apart from that it also showcases the list of popular as well as Intheater movies. 

* It follows *Master-Detail Flow* where clicking on a particular movie opens up the Movie Details Activity which shows all the information about the movie and the user can also be further redirected to the relevant IMDB & TMDB websites. 

* The app heavily follows guidelines given in the **Material Design** specifications.


* Here is a **Video** for the complete UX flow experience -  [Video Link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B-jl3CcjD3FtTENoazQ0Ty14anc/view)
